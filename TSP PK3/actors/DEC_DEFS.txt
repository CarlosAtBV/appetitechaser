/*//////////////////////////////////////////

script "AmmoGiveLS" (int which, int GiveNormal, int GiveLS, int msgthrow) 

which - which ammo according to above definitions, can use number or AMMOGIVE_name

GiveNormal - amount given on non-LS difficulties

GiveLS - amount given in LS difficulty

msgthrow - whether or not pickup message is given via hudmessage, and whether item 
is thrown if actor does not pick it up; see below

Script will return 1 if at least some of the ammo was picked up by the actor, and 0 if not. 

To specify clips and ammo for pistol and ammobox, give # of mags (other than 1) 
in multilples of 1m, bullets in mag in 1k and ammo normally. For instance, to 
give 3 full pistol mags or 50 ammo, give 3015050. To give either 15 ammo or a 
single mag containing 20 ammo, give 20015. If # of mags is ommitted it defaults to 
one. If # of mags is provided but mag amount is ommitted, mag amount defaults to 
full. If this feature isn't used it will behave like mag pickup scripts normally 
do, and either give an ammo amount equal to a typical item or a mag of the 
specified size. 

To have "msgthrow" throw the item if it's not picked up, add 10 to it.
To have "msgthrow" give a pickup message via hudmessage, add 1 to it. 
For instance, 11 would cause both to happen.
Note: Throw not in yet.
